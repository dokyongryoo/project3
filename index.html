One thing that I noted though is that the back and forth behind Spider-Man's story and Spider-Woman's story made the film feel choppy at times (mainly in the beginning); I also didn't realize it would end as a cliffhanger which made me stunned.

        <img src="B.jpeg" alt="<br>Was it cringey? Yes. Did I feel uncomf watching Ryan Gosling thirst trapping? Yes. Was I annoyed by the presence of Simu Liu? Yes. Did I enjoy the film regardless? Yes üòÄ Incredible set, music, costuming, & acting. Some gaps in the logistics story-wise, but the narrative is quite straightforward & the humor generally well received. Several critics pointed out that this movie felt hollow / is simply liberal feminism the movie. But not every movie needs to have complex characters & insightful, life changing personal development. At the end of the day, Barbie the movie is based off a doll toy - it's not surprising to me that more couldn't be (/ perhaps deliberately wasn't) done for actually showcasing the struggles that women face. Some say that Barbie has no meaningful narrative arc, but what is not meaningful about a story where a girl finds beauty in life? In (after going on a journey to the real world that started with a lack of excitement) choosing to accept and live in the real world as it is rather than live in the comfort of Barbieland? Additionally, perhaps her inoffensive nature is what makes her significant as a character. At her core she is ordinary Barbie as she is stereotypical Barbie. & she is powerful despite this characterization. Anyways, I also loved the opening / closing of the film. Incredible references to 2001: A Space Odyssey & The Matrix at the beginning, & the closing lowkey made me think about how conditioned my mind was to capitalist ideals (I assumed she was going to a job interview) lol. Thought about the movie for a while even after getting out of the cinema bc as much as it was all good vibes & YASS WOMEN POWER üíñüòç it made me feel sad. Men will never fully comprehend what it means to live as a woman, this movie shows j the tip of the iceberg. The fact that, in the plot, the company structure doesn't change (CEO of Barbie remains an incompetent man who has a competent female assistant) + CEO doesn't even take a second to to consider her suggestion of ordinary Barbie is really representative of the sexism that's entrenched in the real world. I wonder how many in the audience recognized this scene of structural sexism after the countless hollow jokes of sexism throughout the film." style="width:100%" class="w3-hover-opacity" onclick="onClick(this)">
